# Fishery Overview {-}
The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (Department) golden king crab (GKC) fishery in Southeast Alaska is a data-limited fishery that is managed based on a 3-S management system (sex, size, and season) that has been further developed by limiting the number of participants and gear, establishing guideline harvest levels (GHLs) for each management area, and allowing for closure of management areas if there are stock health concerns. The majority of the harvest occurs in the commercial sector where the fishery extends across 7 management areas (Northern, Icy Strait, North Stephens Passage, East Central, Mid and Lower Chatham Strait, and Southern). Annually the Department evaluates stock status and establishes GHLs for each management area using fishery dependent data  [@olson2018spatial, @stratman2017]. 

The GKC fishery rapidly developed after the collapse of the red and blue king crab fisheries in the early 1980s with harvest subsequently peaking in the late 1980s and early 2010s while also experiencing a period of collapse in the 1990s. Harvest has been steadily declining since 2011 and many of the management areas are currently in a collapsed state [@olson2018spatial, @stratman2017, @stratman2020].

The purpose of this document is to lay the framework for a consistent and transparent in-season and post season approach in determining GHLs and closing fisheries if warranted. The harvest strategy described herein will be treated as a guideline for managing GKC and not a prescriptive step by step approach. Many other factors and sources of information can affect determining GHLs or closing of fisheries that cannot be simply be captured in a prescriptive framework.

## Biology {-}
Golden king crab are relatively long-lived slow growing species that have an asynchronous 20-month reproductive cycle, morphometric maturity at approximately 8 years of age, lecithotrophic larvae that remain at depth, and exhibit spatial variability in size at maturity across the North Pacific and among the 7 management areas within Southeast Alaska where size at maturity increases with increases in latitude. Certain aspects of this species' life history are well documented whereas other critical components such as, growth rates, age at maturity, longevity, etc. are unknown [@hebert2008, @long2016, @nizyaev2005, @olson2018spatial, @sloan1985, @somerton1986].  


## Proposed plan {-}
Metrics to assess stock health and fishery performance. In-season fishery performance data will be reviewed and analyzed bi-weekly to inform harvest strategy decision rules in-season and determine GHLs post-season. 

### Fishery Objective {-}
The primary objective of this harvest strategy is to rebuild the Southeast Alaska GKC resource to sustainable levels while minimizing and mitigating ecological risks from fishing related activities, monitoring social and economic benefits of the fishery to the community, maintain various size and age compositions of stocks in order to maintain long-term reproductive viability, minimize handling and unnecessary mortality of non-legal GKC and non-target species, and reducing dependency on annual recruitment. These objectives remain consistent with Board of Fisheries' Policy on King and Tanner Crab Resource Management (90-04-FB, March 23, 1990).

## Performance Indicators {-}
The primary performance indicator used in this harvest strategy is commercial catch rate defined as logbook catch of GKC per unit of effort (CPUE) calculated from the CPUE at each logbook entry and averaged for the entire season. Commercial catch rate is the number of legal sized male golden king crab per pot lift. Future iterations will incorporate soak time component in order to standardize CPUE.

Secondary performance indicators that may be used in this harvest strategy includes commercial catch rate obtained from fish ticket data where CPUE is calculated from each harvest landing for the entire season divided by the difference of the first and last catch date which is defined as active fishing season. This secondary CPUE indicator is defined as pounds per pot day and will aid in understanding catch rates over time in a given season until enough soak time information is collected to standardize logbook CPUE. 

In addition, due to the GKC and Tanner crab fishery occurring concurrently it is difficult to differentiate between GKC that are harvested as bycatch or directly targeted which can bias logbook CPUE and may trigger management actions in- and post season. In order to evaluate this concern a proportion of $\geq$ X% will be applied to GKC catch from commercial logbooks.    

Supplementary information that will be evaluated in this harvest strategy includes biological, local ecological knowledge (LEK), and other anecdotal information that may not be captured in this harvest strategy framework.
  
  + Biological information will be evaluated by analyzing recruit class and size distributions of GKC sampled during commercial landings. Size of GKC is defined as the carapace length (CL) mm measurement and recruit class is used as an indicator of shell age and is defined as recruit (new shell) and post-recruit (old shell);
  + LEK is experiential information from fishermen and the fishing industry  about the natural environment as it pertains to GKC that will be evaluated and reviewed through permit holder comments in logbooks, communication with permit holders and industry representatives, and discussion at annual industry meetings.  


## Reference Points {-}
The primary indicator Target Reference Point (RP~targ~) is set at the average logbook CPUE for the years 2000-2017 as these years capture when logbooks were required for the fishery in 2000 and represents contrasting data (highs and lows) in fishery performance with the exception of North Stephens Passage (excludes 2000) and Lower Chatham (excludes 2013) The Trigger Reference Point (RP~trig~) is set at 75% of the RP~targ~ and the Limit Reference Point (RP~lim~) is set at 50% of the RP~targ~.

## Monitoring Strategy {-}

### Decision Rules {-}
The primary performance indicator (logbook CPUE rounded to the nearest tenth) being the most readily available estimate of fishery performance the following decision rules will be considered to guide in-season and post-season management decisions.


* **In-Season**
    + Fishery performance will be monitored bi-weekly and/or with a minimum of 500 pot lifts being required before taking management action whichever is the least restrictive under the following guidelines:
        - If logbook CPUE is $\geq$ RP~targ~ manage to GHL in-season;
        - If logbook CPUE is $\geq$ RP~trig~ but $<$ RP~targ~ manage to GHL in-season and monitor closely;
        - If logbook CPUE is $\geq$ RP~lim~ and $<$ RP~trig~ fishery early in-season;
        - If logbook CPUE is $<$ RP~lim~ close fishery early in-season and subject to multiple year closure (1-year min.) for commercial and personal use fisheries the following season upon post-season review.
    
    + GHLs will not be changed in-season and are only subject to change per the post-season decision rules.

    + Due to the GKC and Tanner crab fishery occurring concurrently permit holders are encouraged to indicate when they are targeting GKC or when GKC was harvested as bycatch as this can bias logbook CPUE.
    
* **Post-Season **
    + **Increase in the GHL**
        - If the most recent CPUE is $>$ than the most recent season and is $>$ RP~targ~ the GHL may increase up to a maximum of 20% the following season;
        - If the most recent CPUE is $>$ than the most recent season and $\leq$ RP~targ~ and $>$ RP~trig~ the GHL may increase up to a maximum of 10% the following season;
        - If the most recent CPUE is $>$ than the most recent season and is $\leq$ RP~trig~ and $>$ RP~limit~ the GHL may increase up to a maximum of 5% the following season;
        - New GHLs may not exceed respective management area GHRs;
      
    + **Decrease in the GHL**
        - **If the fishery closed short of a GHL in-season due to poor fishery performance and/or the most recent CPUE is $<$ than the previous season the GHL will be decreased based on the following conditions:**
        - If CPUE is $<$ the most recent season and $>$ RP~targ~ the GHL may be reduced up to a maximum of 20% the following season;
        - If CPUE is $<$ than the most recent season and is $>$ RP~trig~ and $\leq$ RP~targ~ the GHL may be reduced up to a maximum of 40% the following season;
        - If the fishery closed short in-season due to poor fishery performance and CPUE is $<$ than the most recent season and $>$ RP~lim~ then the GHL decrease the following season may be within 20% of the total harvest at the time of closure during the most recent season, but not less than 7,500 lbs;   
      
    + **Closure and Re-opening**
        - If logbook CPUE is $<$ the RP~lim~ further management action may be required by implementing an area closure of a minimum of 1 year to reduce the risk of localized depletion;
        - Upon re-opening an area after a closure the GHL will be equal to the harvest at the time of closure rounded to the nearest 1,000 lbs and must not be less than 7,500 lbs whichever is greatest. 

        
* **Review of GHLs or Decision Rules**
    + If and when new information becomes available indicating that the harvest strategy framework and GHL setting decision rules are not consistent with the Board's policy in managing a sustainable GKC resource, the decision rules must be reviewed and if appropriate the reference points must be adjusted.
   
### Other Considerations for Management and Future Recommendations {-}
Logbook CPUE currently lacks a soak time data field and cannot be standardized for comparison across years. Soak time was introduced as a reporting field in logbooks for the 2020 fishing season and will be used in informing this harvest strategy in future iterations. In the interim active fishing season may be looked at as a secondary performance indicator to assess fishery performance in lieu of soak time. 

This harvest strategy may be amended in future iterations as more information and tools becomes available, drivers external to the management of the fishery such as, environmental, climate, economic, and LEK, or the harvest strategy is not working effectively all of which should be conducted collaboratively with industry. This harvest strategy provides a first step in increasing transparency regarding management metrics utilized in-season and post season and it is recommended that this harvest strategy is further developed through the use of a management strategy evaluation (MSE) to provided robustness and stability.
