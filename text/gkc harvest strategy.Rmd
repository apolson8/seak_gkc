# Background {-}
The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (Department) golden king crab (*Lithodes aequispinus*, GKC) fishery in Southeast Alaska is a data-limited fishery that is managed based on a 3-S management system (sex, size, and season). The management has been further developed by limiting the number of participants and gear, establishing guideline harvest levels (GHLs) that are set within guideline harvest ranges (GHRs) for each management area (Table 1), and allowing closure of management areas if there are stock health concerns. Most of the harvest occurs in the commercial sector where the fishery extends across seven management areas (Northern, Icy Strait, North Stephens Passage, East Central, Mid and Lower Chatham Strait, and Southern). The Department annually evaluates stock status and establishes GHLs for each management area using fishery dependent data  [@olson2018spatial; @stratman2017]. 

The commercial GKC fishery rapidly developed after the collapse of the red and blue king crab fisheries in the early 1980s. Harvest subsequently peaked in the late 1980s and early 2010s, experiencing a period of collapse in the 1990s. Harvest has been steadily declining since 2011 and many of the management areas are currently closed due to historically low fishery performance [@olson2018spatial; @stratman2017; @stratman2020].

## Biology {-}
Golden king crab are relatively long-lived slow growing species that have an asynchronous 20-month reproductive cycle [@long2016; @somerton1986], morphometric maturity at approximately 8 years of age [@hebert2008; @koeneman1985; @paul2001], lecithotrophic larvae that remain at depth [@long2016; @shirley1997; @sloan1985]. Golden king crab exhibit spatial variability in size at maturity across the North Pacific and among the seven management areas within Southeast Alaska where size at maturity increases with increases in latitude [@jewett1985; @nizyaev2005; @olson2018spatial; @somerton1986]. Certain aspects of this species' life history are well documented whereas other critical components such as, growth rates, age at maturity, longevity, etc. are unknown. 


## Purpose {-}
The purpose of this document is to lay the framework for a consistent and transparent inseason and postseason approach to determine GHLs and close fisheries when warranted. The harvest strategy described herein remains consistent with the Board of Fisheries' Policy on King and Tanner Crab Resource Management (90-04-FB, March, 1990) [5 AAC 34.080], the Southeast Alaska Golden King Crab Management Plan [5 AAC 34.114], and will be treated as a guideline for managing GKC and not a prescriptive step by step approach. Many factors and sources of information can affect determining GHLs or closing of fisheries that cannot be captured in a prescriptive framework. 


# Management Goals and Objectives{-}
The primary goal and objective is to recommend a harvest strategy for Southeast Alaska GKC to improve and stabilize fishery performance using transparent and repeatable metrics (and their rationale) to evaluate stock health and measure performance for more consistent inseason and postseason management. Additional goals and objectives include minimizing and mitigating ecological risks from fishing related activities, maintaining various size and age compositions of stocks in order to maintain long-term reproductive viability; minimizing handling and unnecessary mortality of non-legal GKC and non-target species; and reducing dependency on annual recruitment. 

Harvest strategies have been implemented for the GKC fisheries in the Aleutian Islands and Pribilof Islands to improve fisheries management and sustainability. These harvest strategies are comprised of biological, fishery dependent and independent reference points (i.e. mature male biomass, CPUE, annual recruitment, etc.) that are used in recommending the total allowable catch (TAC) or GHL for a given management area and season [@daly2019; @daly2020; @siddeek2020]. 

## Harvest Strategy {-}
Herein is a harvest strategy for GKC in Southeast Alaska that informs inseason and postseason management using fishery dependent performance indicators and management decision rules. 


### Performance Indicators {-}
The primary performance indicator used in this harvest strategy is commercial catch rate defined as logbook catch of GKC per unit of effort (CPUE):


\begin{equation}
CPUE_{le} = \frac{catch}{effort}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}

where *CPUE* is the catch of legal size male GKC per unit of *effort (pot lifts)* for each logbook entry (*le*). Equation (1) is then applied to all logbook entries and averaged for a given management area and season where:

\begin{equation}
\overline{CPUE_{a,s}} = \frac{\sum{CPUE_{le}}}{n}
\tag{2} 
\end{equation}

where *a* is a given management area, *s* is a given season, and *n* is the total number of logbook entries. Future iterations will incorporate soak time in order to standardize CPUE.

Due to the GKC and Tanner crab fishery occurring concurrently, it is difficult to differentiate between GKC that are harvested as bycatch or directly targeted. GKC that are harvested as bycatch can bias logbook CPUE and consequently trigger management actions during and after the season. To evaluate this concern a proportion of $\geq$ 60% will be applied to GKC catch from commercial logbooks:

\begin{equation}
catch_{le}^{\geq{0.6}} = \frac{crab_{gkc}}{({total \ crab}_{gkc + tc})}
\tag{3}
\end{equation}

where *catch* is for a given logbook entry (*le*), *gkc* is golden king crab and *tc* is Tanner crab. Then subsequently Equations (1) and (2) will be applied to calculate CPUE.

Secondary performance indicators include biological, local ecological knowledge (LEK), and other anecdotal information that may not be captured quantitatively in this harvest strategy framework.
  
  + Biological information will be evaluated by analyzing carapace length (CL) mm frequencies by area and season for recruit classes of GKC sampled during commercial landings. Size of GKC is defined as the CL measurement. Recruit class is used as an indicator of shell age and is defined as recruit (new shell and a CL of 151–166mm) and postrecruit (new or old shell and a CL $\geq$ 167 mm).
  + LEK is experiential information from fishermen and the fishing industry  about the natural environment as it pertains to GKC. LEK will be evaluated and reviewed through permit holder comments in logbooks, communication with permit holders and industry representatives, and discussion at annual industry meetings [@ainsworth2011; @beaudreau2014]. Examples of LEK include lots of crab (recruits, females, and undersized), females with full clutches, softshell, sand fleas, bad weather, large tides, and parasitized crab.

## Reference Points {-}
The primary indicator Target Reference Point (RP~targ~) for each management area and is set at the average logbook CPUE for the years 2000-2017 because these years capture logbook requirements for the fishery in 2000 and represents contrasting data (highs and lows) in fishery performance. The exception to this includes North Stephens Passage (excludes 2000) and Lower Chatham (excludes 2013) due to having substantial outliers in those given years that influenced the Target Reference Point. The Trigger Reference Point (RP~trig~) is set between the Target and Limit Reference Point that prompts management actions and is set at 75% of the RP~targ~. The Limit Reference Point (RP~lim~) is set at the level at which stocks are considered in a danger zone and are no longer resilient to fishing pressure and is set at 50% of the RP~targ~.

## Monitoring Strategy {-}
Herein lies a monitoring strategy with associated decision rules for inseason and post season management of GKC. 

### Decision Rules {-}
As the primary performance indicator is the most readily available estimate of fishery performance the following decision rules will guide inseason and postseason management decisions.


* **Inseason**
    + Fishery performance will be assessed biweekly and/or with a minimum requirement of 500 pot lifts before taking management action whichever is the least restrictive under the following guidelines:
        - If logbook CPUE is $\geq$ RP~targ~ manage to GHL.
        - If logbook CPUE is $\geq$ RP~trig~ but $<$ RP~targ~ manage to GHL and monitor closely.
        - If logbook CPUE is $\geq$ RP~lim~ and $<$ RP~trig~ fishery close early.
        - If logbook CPUE is $<$ RP~lim~ close fishery early **and** subsequent closure of management area for a minimum of 1 year for commercial and personal use fisheries the following season, depending upon a postseason review.
    
    + GHLs will not be changed inseason and are only subject to change per postseason decision rules.

    
* **Postseason **
    + **Increase in a GHL**
        - If the most recent logbook CPUE is $>$ than the most recent previous season and is $>$ RP~targ~ the GHL may increase up to a maximum of 20% the following season.
        - If the most recent logbook CPUE is $>$ than the most recent previous season and $\leq$ RP~targ~ and $>$ RP~trig~ the GHL may increase up to a maximum of 10% the following season.
        - If the most recent logbook CPUE is $>$ than the most recent previous season and is $\leq$ RP~trig~ and $>$ RP~limit~ the GHL may increase up to a maximum of 5% the following season.
        - New GHLs may not exceed respective management area GHRs.
      
    + **Decrease in a GHL**
        - **If the fishery closed short of a GHL inseason due to poor fishery performance and/or the most recent CPUE is $<$ than the previous season the GHL will be decreased based on the following conditions:**
        - If CPUE is $<$ than the most recent previous season and is $>$ RP~trig~ and $\leq$ RP~targ~ the GHL may be reduced up to a maximum of 40% the following season.
        - If CPUE is $<$ than the most recent previous season and is $>$ RP~lim~ and $\leq$ RP~trig~ the GHL may be reduced up to a maximum of 60% the following season.
      
    + **Closure and Re-opening**
        - If logbook CPUE is $<$ the RP~lim~ further management action may be required by implementing an area closure of a minimum of 1 year to reduce the risk of localized depletion.
        - Upon re-opening an area after a closure, the GHL will be within 5-10% of the upper end of area respective GHRs.

        
* **Review of GHLs or Decision Rules**
    + If and when new information becomes available indicating that the harvest strategy framework and GHL setting decision rules are not consistent with the Board's policy of managing a sustainable GKC resource, the decision rules must be reviewed and the reference points must be adjusted accordingly.
   
### Other Considerations for Management and Future Recommendations {-}
Logbook CPUE currently lacks a soak time data field and cannot be standardized for comparison across years. Soak time was introduced as a reporting field in logbooks for the 2020 fishing season and will be used to inform this harvest strategy in future iterations.

This harvest strategy may be amended in future iterations as more information and tools become available. This harvest strategy is a first step to increase transparency regarding management metrics utilized for inseason and postseason decisions. We recommend that this harvest strategy is further developed using a management strategy evaluation (MSE). A MSE is a tool that uses simulation to test how well a harvest strategy performs and if the objectives of the harvest strategy are being achieved [@goethel2019; @punt2016].

# Management Area Reports
Each management area report will provide an overview of seasonal trends in fishery performance through the most recent season. This includes comparing harvest (lbs) to corresponding GHLs, logbook CPUE compared to reference points (i.e. target, trigger, and limit), reviewing Tanner crab harvest influence, and spatial distribution of incidental catch during the annual Tanner crab stock assessment survey in Holkham Bay. Confidential harvest and effort data have been excluded from figures if less than 3 permit holders participated in a given management area for a given year.
