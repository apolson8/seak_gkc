# Background {-}
The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (Department) golden king crab (*Lithodes aequispinus*, GKC) fishery in Southeast Alaska is a data-limited fishery that is managed based on a 3-S management system (sex, size, and season). The management has been further developed by limiting the number of participants and gear, establishing guideline harvest levels (GHLs) that are set within guideline harvest ranges (GHRs) for each management area and allowing closure of management areas if there are stock health concerns. Most of the harvest occurs in the commercial sector where the fishery extends across seven management areas (Northern, Icy Strait, North Stephens Passage, East Central, Mid and Lower Chatham Strait, and Southern). The Department annually evaluates stock status and establishes GHLs for each management area using fishery dependent data. 

The commercial GKC fishery rapidly developed after the collapse of the red and blue king crab fisheries in the early 1980s. Harvest subsequently peaked in the late 1980s and early 2010s, experiencing a period of collapse in the 1990s. Harvest has been steadily declining since 2011 and many of the management areas are currently closed due to historically low fishery performance.


## Biology {-}
Golden king crab are relatively long-lived slow growing species that have an asynchronous 20-month reproductive cycle, morphometric maturity at approximately 8 years of age, lecithotrophic larvae that remain at depth. Golden king crab exhibit spatial variability in size at maturity across the North Pacific and among the seven management areas within Southeast Alaska where size at maturity increases with increases in latitude. Certain aspects of this species' life history are well documented whereas other critical components such as, growth rates, age at maturity, longevity, etc. are unknown. 


## Purpose {-}
The purpose of this document is to lay the framework for a consistent and transparent inseason and postseason approach to determine GHLs and close fisheries when warranted. The harvest strategy described herein remains consistent with the Board of Fisheries' Policy on King and Tanner Crab Resource Management (90-04-FB, March, 1990) [5 AAC 34.080], the Southeast Alaska Golden King Crab Management Plan [5 AAC 34.114], and will be treated as a guideline for managing GKC and not a prescriptive step by step approach. Many factors and sources of information can affect determining GHLs or closing of fisheries that cannot be captured in a prescriptive framework. 

# Management Goals and Objectives{-}
The primary goal and objective is to recommend a harvest strategy for Southeast Alaska GKC to improve and stabilize fishery performance using transparent and repeatable metrics (and their rationale) to evaluate stock health and measure performance for more consistent inseason and postseason management. Additional goals and objectives include minimizing and mitigating ecological risks from fishing related activities, maintaining various size and age compositions of stocks in order to maintain long-term reproductive viability; minimizing handling and unnecessary mortality of non-legal GKC and non-target species; and reducing dependency on annual recruitment. 

Harvest strategies have been implemented for the GKC fisheries in the Aleutian Islands and Pribilof Islands to improve fisheries management and sustainability. These harvest strategies are comprised of biological, fishery dependent and independent reference points (i.e. mature male biomass, CPUE, annual recruitment, etc.) that are used in recommending the total allowable catch (TAC) or GHL for a given management area and season.
