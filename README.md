## Commercial Fishery Development and History
The department began collecting species composition information from the commercial king
crab harvest in Southeast Alaska in 1970. Reliable golden king crab harvest data have been
available since the 1972/73 fishing season. From the 1972/73 through the 1979/80 seasons,
harvest ranged from about 32,000 to almost 178,000 lb by 20 or fewer permit holders (Table 1).
Effort and harvest increased significantly after the 1979/80 fishing season.

During the 1980/81 through 1989/90 seasons, the average number of permits fished was 65 with
a high of 124 (Table 1). This effort level resulted in an average harvest of 824,383 lb. At current
prices, this would be worth about $10.1 million. These relatively high harvests coincided with
four years of good recruitment starting in 1983. Fishing effort peaked during the 1984/85 season
when 124 permits fished for a harvest of 848,818 lb. The harvest peaked two seasons later during
the 1986/87 season when only 51 permits fished for a harvest of 1,016,011 lb. Although effort
and harvest declined through the 1995/96 season when only 16,000 lb was harvested, they have
increased since then in response to increasing recruitment.

The development of the golden king crab fishery in Southeast Alaska occurred in five phases.
Initial development (first phase) occurred from in 1960 through the 1971/72 fishing season. This
development phase was characterized by fishermen determining which fishing methods, gear
types, depth ranges, geographic areas, and other factors yielded adequate harvests of golden king
crab. Also during this phase, processing facilities developed product forms and studied
marketing potential. Prices and effort were generally low and harvest fluctuated, probably
because red king crab was the primary target species during this phase. The entire fishery was
managed as a single stock. Basic regulations included establishing a quota, gear limits, size
limits, and other regulatory needs. These initial regulations were based on a short history of
commercial exploitation, little scientific information, and experiences in other Alaska king crab
fisheries. Many of these initial regulations changed dramatically as better information became
available.

The second phase occurred during the 1972/73 through 1979/80 seasons and was characterized
by relatively low effort levels but generally increasing harvest. Additional knowledge on gear
requirements, fishing techniques, and geographic distribution of the species became available. 
Exvessel prices continued to be low. Due to concentrated effort and resulting harvest, it was
necessary to reduce fishing time in District 10, and eventually to eliminate the year-round
season.

The third phase began with the 1980/81 fishing season and ended with the 1984/85 fishing
season. Effort gradually increased from 30 to 124 permits fished. A significant portion of the
increase in effort can be attributed to the evolving limited entry program for king and Tanner
crab in Southeast Alaska. Knowledge on gear design and fishing techniques developed to a point
where the available stock could be harvested throughout the range in Southeast Alaska. Fishing
occurred throughout the year in some areas. This phase is important because it showed consistent
increases in harvest that led to a liberalization of some regulations. Specifically, quotas used to
manage the fishery were increased due to industry interactions with the board and the gear limit
was increased to 100 pots per vessel. Although fishing effort and resulting harvest were
increasing, scientific information sufficient to properly manage stocks was not available.
The fourth phase began with the 1985/86 fishing season and extended through the 1995/96
fishing season. The peak harvest of slightly more than one million pounds occurred during the
1986/87 season and declined through the 1995/96 season due to lack of recruitment and
overexploitation. The fishery was separated into five management areas with GHRs established
in each area in an attempt to prevent further overexploitation in any single area or serial
depletion of a number of fishing areas. The department has used emergency order authority to
close the fishery early each season, when data indicated that substantial recruitment had not
entered the fishery and stocks were not strong enough to support significant harvest. The effort
and harvest declined for seven seasons, to a low of 15,845 lb in 1995/96.

The fifth and current phase began with the 1996/97 fishing season. Effort increased in response
to improved prices with the development of a live market and harvest increased as a result of
increases in the availability of recruit size crab. Anecdotal information from pot shrimp
fishermen in Frederick Sound and Clarence Strait during previous years indicated a very
significant increase in the number of juvenile golden king crab. By the 1996/97 season these
juvenile crab had recruited to legal size, surviving at relatively high levels. Recruitment had
remained fairly high since 1996/97 leading a slow, but consistent increase in GHLs and seasonal
harvest. Between the 2000/01 and 2009/10 seasons, annual harvests improved again averaging
603,171 lb. Harvests in the most recent decade showed a precipitous decline, similar to that seen
in the early to mid-1990s, averaging 328,798 lb since the 2010/11 season. Substantial reductions
to GHLs began prior to the 2012/13 season and continued through the 2016/17 season in the
majority of areas based on harvest ticket/logbook, port sampling, and onboard observer data.
Inseason closures short of fishery area GHLs have also been prevalent in the fishery in the last
five seasons based on poor fishery performance, in order to avoid damage to the long-term
reproductive potential of the stock.
